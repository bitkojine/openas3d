### Getting started

1. Open any folder that contains source files you want to explore in 3D.

2. Build and install the VSCode extension:

```zsh
cd vscode-extension
```

```zsh
npm install
```

```zsh
npm run build-install-test
```

3. If VSCode prompts you in the Extensions sidebar, restart extensions using the UI button.

4. Start **OpenAs3D** using the VSCode Command Palette and running:

```
>Openas3D: Open as 3D World
```

The current workspace will be opened as a navigable 3D world.
