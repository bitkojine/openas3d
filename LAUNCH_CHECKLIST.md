🚀 Just shipped OpenAs3D - a VSCode extension that lets you explore codebases in 3D!

Instead of scrolling through flat file trees, walk through your code using WASD controls like a video game.

✨ Height = complexity
🎨 Color = language  
🔗 Click objects to open files

Try it: [link to .vsix]

🎉 Excited to share OpenAs3D - a new way to explore codebases!

After years of scrolling through flat file trees, I built a VSCode extension that lets developers walk through their code in 3D space.

Why 3D? Your brain's spatial memory is incredibly powerful. You remember "the big complex module in the northwest corner" better than "UserService.ts line 47."

Perfect for:
• Onboarding new team members
• Understanding unfamiliar codebases  
• Architecture discussions
• Code reviews

The extension analyzes your codebase and renders files as 3D objects where:
• Height represents complexity
• Color represents programming language
• Position shows architectural relationships

Navigate with WASD controls, click objects to select them, double-click to open files in the editor.

Available now as a VSCode extension. Looking for developers who want to try a spatial approach to code navigation!

Title: [Show /r/programming] I built a VSCode extension for exploring codebases in 3D

I got tired of scrolling through endless file trees, so I built OpenAs3D - a VSCode extension that lets you walk through your codebase like a video game.

**What it does:**
- Analyzes your codebase (TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, etc.)
- Renders files as 3D objects in space
- Height = complexity, Color = language
- Navigate with WASD + mouse controls
- Click objects to select, double-click to open files

**Why 3D?**
Spatial memory is powerful. You remember locations better than lists. "The big red cluster in the corner" vs "line 47 in the file tree."

**Perfect for:**
- Understanding unfamiliar codebases
- Onboarding new developers
- Architecture discussions
- Finding complexity hotspots

The extension is ready to try - works with any VSCode workspace. Looking for feedback from developers who want to experiment with spatial code navigation!

"Tired of scrolling through file trees? Let me show you a different way to explore code."

[Command Palette: "Explore Dependencies in 3D"]
"OpenAs3D transforms your codebase into a navigable 3D world."

[3D world opens, WASD navigation]
"Walk through your code using WASD controls. Height shows complexity, color shows language."

[Click object, file opens]
"Click objects to select them, double-click to open files. Your brain remembers spatial locations better than flat lists."

[Text overlay: "OpenAs3D - Available now for VSCode"]
"Ready to explore your code in 3D?"
