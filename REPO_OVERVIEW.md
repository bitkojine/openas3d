# OpenAs3D - Repository Overview

OpenAs3D is a Visual Studio Code extension that transforms your codebase into a navigable 3D world. It treats complex systems as spatial environments, leveraging human spatial memory to reduce cognitive load and improve architectural orientation.

## Guiding Principles
- **Systems are places, not diagrams**: Navigable environments provide better context than static trees or lists.
- **Exploration precedes explanation**: Visual movement helps discover structural patterns.
- **Spatial memory reduces cognitive load**: Knowing "where" a component lives helps in recalling "what" it does.
- **IDE Integration**: Designed as a specialized tool within the developer's existing workflow.

## Technology Stack
- **Languages**: TypeScript (Strict mode)
- **3D Engine**: Three.js (v0.158.0)
- **Frontend Layer**: VSCode Webview (HTML/CSS/TS)
- **Build System**: Webpack 5 (configured for production and development modes)
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with `ts-jest` for unit and integration tests

## Repository Structure
The primary logic is contained within the `vscode-extension` directory.

### Key Directories & Files
- `src/extension.ts`: Main entry point; registers `openas3d.openAs3DWorld` and `openas3d.exploreDependencies`.
- `src/visualizers/`:
    - `codebase-analyzer.ts`: Asynchronously crawls workspace files, gathering size and type data.
    - `codebase-layout.ts`: Implements the 8-zone system for spatial organization (e.g., source, tests, config).
    - `codebase.ts`: Orchestrates analysis and layout computation.
- `src/webview/`:
    - `world-renderer.ts`: Manages the Three.js scene, camera, and basic lighting.
    - `code-object-manager.ts`: Handles Mesh creation, labeling, and Level of Detail (LOD) for code units.
    - `character-controller.ts`: Implements First-Person game-like movement (WASD + Mouse).
    - `interaction-controller.ts`: Manages user interactions (clicking objects, hover effects).
    - `dependency-manager.ts`: Renders 3D lines representing imports/exports between code objects.
    - `zone-visuals.ts`: Renders environmental markers like fences and signs.
    - `texture-factory.ts`: Efficiently generates materials and textures for 3D objects.
- `src/utils/`:
    - `languageRegistry.ts`: Centralized mapping of file extensions to language categories and colors.
    - `messaging.ts`: Typed protocol for Host-to-Webview communication.

## Architectural Flow
1. **Command Trigger**: User runs `Open as 3D World` from the Command Palette.
2. **Analysis**: `CodebaseAnalyzer` scans the local workspace using the VSCode FileSystem API.
3. **Layout Generation**: `CodebaseLayout` calculates (X, Y, Z) coordinates based on the folder structure and file categories.
4. **Webview Initialization**: `panel.ts` creates the webview and injects the layout data.
5. **3D Reconstruction**: The `WorldRenderer` in the webview builds the Three.js scene from the layout data.
6. **Live Sync**: Interactions in the 3D world (like double-clicking a file) message the Extension Host to open the file in a standard VSCode editor tab.

## Development Workflow
- **Initialization**: `cd vscode-extension && npm install`
- **Build & Watch**: `npm run watch` for development.
- **Testing**: `npm test` runs the suite.
- **VSIX Packaging**: `npm run package` generates the `.vsix` extension file.
