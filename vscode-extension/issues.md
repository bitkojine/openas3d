# issues

- When the mouse/trackpad cursor is captured after clicking on the 3D view, the cursor should also be centered in the 3D view, so that when click on things we could aim with the center of the screen. Right now the cursor gets locked at point of click and it's not centered, so it makes aiming at objects difficult FIXED

- When clicking on an object once in the 3D view, file should be selected in the file explorer, should stay in sync like this.

- in object label, change date format, and add commas to byte size numbers
