# OpenAs3D: Feature & Capability Catalog

This document serves as the definitive record of the features, architectural goals, and capabilities implemented in the `feat/hot-reload-optimization` branch.

## 1. Core Architectural Pillars

The system architecture was designed to transition from a collection of scripts to a robust, enterprise-grade application framework.

- **Centralized Lifecycle Orchestration**: A state-machine driven core that governs the entire extension lifecycle, ensuring deterministic transitions between initialization, active operation, and teardown.
- **Race Condition Immunity**: An event-driven communication model that prevents out-of-order execution, particularly during window reloads and webview state transitions.
- **Synchronized Extension-Webview Handshake**: A reliable synchronization protocol that ensures the backend extension and the frontend webview are always in a consistent, "ready" state before exchanging data.
- **Coordinated State Persistence**: A system-wide snapshotting mechanism that captures and validates the entire application state (entities, UI, player) across sessions and reloads.
### Thread-Safe State Persistence
- **Coordinated Snapshots**: Capturing the entire system state (layout, UI, player position) before window reloads.
- **Integrity Validation**: Checksum and TTL-based verification for persisted state to prevent loading stale or corrupted data.
- **Automated State Restoration**: Coordinated protocol to restore the 3D world, player position, and UI state immediately following an extension reload or restart.
- **Deduplicated Saves**: Logic to prevent redundant state saves during rapid changes.
- **Fault Tolerance & Resilience**: A multi-layered error handling system featuring "Circuit Breakers" to isolate failing components and automated recovery strategies for known failure modes.

## 2. 3D Navigation & Interaction

- **Advanced Character Physics**: A custom controller supporting both standard physics-based ground movement and an unconstrained "Flight Mode."
- **Precision Movement Simulation**: Capabilities to programmatically teleport the player and perform smooth, animated camera transitions to specific targets.
- **Dynamic 3D Layout Engine**: An optimized algorithm for generating navigable "Code Parks," featuring logical zone classification and compact pathing.
- **Customizable Landmarks (Monuments)**: Support for distinctive 3D landmarks that serve as both visual anchors and demonstration units for hot reload capabilities.
- **Standardized Object Interactions**: Integrated support for object dragging, multi-selection, and context-sensitive actions within the 3D space.

### Visual Foundations & Layout
- **Dynamic Zone Classification**: Improved logic for grouping files into logical "Architectural Zones" based on path priority and importance.
- **Monument Entities**: New class of "Monument" objects to represent key architectural landmarks in the codebase.
- **Advanced Layout Algorithms**: Refined code park generation to create more compact, navigable structures with thinner pathways.
- **Streaming Analysis & Progressive Rendering**: System for scanning the codebase and streaming results to the UI as they are discovered, allowing for near-instant 3D world visualization.

## 3. User Interface & Experience

- **Minimalist Integrated HUD**: A themed, collapsible head-up display that consolidates system status, versioning, and performance metrics.
- **Navigable World Legend**: A reactive UI component providing an "at-a-glance" overview of the 3D world's structure and the player's current focus.
- **Integrated TDD Dashboard**: A visual center for monitoring test suite execution, providing real-time feedback within the 3D environment.
- **Live Extension Metrics**: A user-facing stats panel displaying extension performance data.
- **Sign Management System**: Functionality to place, edit, and persist informational signs within the 3D world.

## 4. Observability & Performance Tracking

- **High-Resolution Performance Profiling**: A tracing system capable of capturing method execution times across the entire extension.
- **Chrome-Compatible Trace Export**: Ability to export performance data in a format compatible with professional-grade profiling tools (Chrome DevTools).
- **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: Continuous reporting of extension health and latency metrics directly to the user interface.

## 5. Automated Verification & DevOps

- **Bi-directional Test Bridge**: A specialized communication layer that exposes the internal state of the 3D world (Three.js scene, entities, physics) for automated testing.
- **Programmatic Interaction Testing**: Ability to simulate complex user behaviors (keyboard inputs, pointer movements, dragging) via automated scripts.
- **Scene-Aware Validation**: Capability to perform deep assertions on the 3D world state, verifying the presence and properties of code entities.
- **Standardized Release Lifecycle**: A fully automated pipeline for versioning, changelog generation, and VSIX packaging based on industry-standard conventions.
